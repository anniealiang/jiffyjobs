# JiffyJobs

JiffyJobs is a virtual job board that acts like a middleman for students seeking for jobs and individuals who are seeking for temporary workers. These jobs are meant to be quick,  simple, and low skill for students who either want to be proactive during their spare time or are running low on money.
